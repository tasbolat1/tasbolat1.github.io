Our latest work on grasp synthesis is accepted to R:SS 2024 (29% acceptance rate). Now we can optimize grasps using multiple classifiers using *GRaCE*. Unlike *GraspFlow*, it takes into account a hierarchical rule! Check out the paper *GRaCE: Balancing Multiple Criteria to Achieve Stable, Safe, and Functional Grasps* on [ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08887).
