<!-- I am Member of Technical Team at Light Robotics. I work on various projects, specifically on Vision-Action-Language (VLA) models for manipulation and more.

**Previously**, I receieved my PhD from [Dexbot](https://yan-wu.com/research/), [A\*STAR](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/) and [CLeAR](https://clear-nus.github.io/), [NUS](https://www.nus.edu.sg/).

Hi, there! I am Tasbolat, a final year PhD student at the School of Computing in the National University of Singapore (NUS). I am supervised by [Dr. Yan Wu](https://yan-wu.com/) and [Dr. Harold Soh](https://haroldsoh.com/). My PhD study is funded by [SINGA](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/Scholarships/for-graduate-studies/singapore-international-graduate-award-singa) scholarship.

My current research interests are **Robot Manipulation**, **Tactile Perception**, **Multimodal Fusion** . I am interested to make robots smarter using artificial intelligence to understand the environment through tactile sensing and vision, perform robotic tasks such as object grasping and manipulation. For more on my background works and publication, please take a look at my <a href="/assets/pdf/CV.pdf" target="_blank">CV</a> and [google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=hMOU2dUAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) page.

**Previously**, I received my M.S. and B.S in Robotics from Nazarbayev University in 2017 and 2015 respectively. During my two year long Master's study, I worked in [ALARIS](https://www.alaris.kz/) lab at [Nazarbayev Uninversity](https://nu.edu.kz/) as a research assistant tackling control problems for both closed and open chain robots.  -->


Hi there! I'm Tasbolat, currently a Member of the Technical Team at Light Robotics. I work on a variety of projects, with a particular focus on Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for robotic manipulation.

I recently completed my Ph.D. at the School of Computing, National University of Singapore (NUS), where I was advised by [Dr. Yan Wu](https://yan-wu.com/) and [Dr. Harold Soh](https://haroldsoh.com/). My Ph.D. was supported by the [SINGA](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/Scholarships/for-graduate-studies/singapore-international-graduate-award-singa) scholarship, and conducted in collaboration with [Dexbot](https://yan-wu.com/research/), [A\*STAR](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/), and [CLeAR](https://clear-nus.github.io/), NUS.

My research interests include **robot manipulation**, **tactile perception**, and **multimodal fusion**. I'm particularly interested in developing intelligent robotic systems that combine tactile sensing and vision to better understand and interact with their environments â€” enabling tasks like object grasping and manipulation.

For more on my background, research, and publications, feel free to take a look at my <a href="/assets/pdf/CV.pdf" target="_blank">CV</a> and [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=hMOU2dUAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) page.

**Earlier in my academic journey**, I received both my M.S. and B.S. degrees in Robotics from Nazarbayev University, in 2017 and 2015 respectively. During my Master's, I worked as a research assistant at the [ALARIS](https://www.alaris.kz/) Lab, where I focused on control challenges in both closed- and open-chain robotic systems.
