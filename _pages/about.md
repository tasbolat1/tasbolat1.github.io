PhD student at [Dexbot](https://yan-wu.com/research/), [A-STAR](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/) and [CLeAR](https://clear-nus.github.io/), [NUS](https://www.nus.edu.sg/).

Hi, there! I am Tasbolat, a final year PhD student at the School of Computing in the National University of Singapore (NUS). I am supervised by [Dr. Yan Wu](https://yan-wu.com/) and [Dr. Harold Soh](https://haroldsoh.com/). My PhD study is funded by [SINGA](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/Scholarships/for-graduate-studies/singapore-international-graduate-award-singa) scholarship.

My current research interests are **Robotic Manipulation**, **Tactile Sensing**, **Multimodal Sensing** and **Control**. I am interested to make robots smarter using artificial intelligence to understand the environment through tactile sensing and vison, perform robotics tasks such as object grasping and manipulation with reliable and executable control methods. More on my background works and publication, please take a look at my CV and [google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=hMOU2dUAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) page.

Previously, I worked as a senior data scientist at telecommunication company between 2017 and 2018. I received my Master's and bachelor's degree in Robotics from Nazarbayev University in 2017 and 2015 respectively. During my two year long Master's study, I worked in [ALARIS](https://www.alaris.kz/) lab at [Nazarbayev Uninversity](https://nu.edu.kz/) as a research assistant.
