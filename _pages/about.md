PhD student at [Dexbot](https://yan-wu.com/research/), [A\*STAR](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/) and [CLeAR](https://clear-nus.github.io/), [NUS](https://www.nus.edu.sg/).

Hi, there! I am Tasbolat, a final year PhD student at the School of Computing in the National University of Singapore (NUS). I am supervised by [Dr. Yan Wu](https://yan-wu.com/) and [Dr. Harold Soh](https://haroldsoh.com/). My PhD study is funded by [SINGA](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/Scholarships/for-graduate-studies/singapore-international-graduate-award-singa) scholarship.

My current research interests are **Robot Manipulation**, **Tactile Reasoning**, **Multimodal Fusion** . I am interested to make robots smarter using artificial intelligence to understand the environment through tactile sensing and vison, perform robotic tasks such as object grasping and manipulation. For more on my background works and publication, please take a look at my <a href="/assets/pdf/CV.pdf" target="_blank">CV</a> and [google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=hMOU2dUAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) page.

**Previously**, I received my M.S. and B.S in Robotics from Nazarbayev University in 2017 and 2015 respectively. During my two year long Master's study, I worked in [ALARIS](https://www.alaris.kz/) lab at [Nazarbayev Uninversity](https://nu.edu.kz/) as a research assistant tackling control problems for both closed and open chain robots.
